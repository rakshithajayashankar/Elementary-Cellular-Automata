# Elementary-Cellular Automata
<h2>Elementary Cellular Automata (1D) Model </h2>
<h4>
This paper aims to understand Wolfram's Cellular Automata as it provides a simple and powerful framework for studying complex systems and emergent phenomena. Using this framework for understanding and predicting employee behavior in both 1D and 2D contexts. 1D Cellular Automata Each cell represents an employee and the behavior evolvement over time based on rules depending on the state of the neighboring employees. In a 2D cellular automata, we look at how employees are arranged in a workplace which lets us observe the interactions and how patterns have emerged in a layout. This contributes to a mechanism driving employee behavior and offers insights for fostering a positive work environment. By using the 2D cellular automaton we gain insights into how spatial arrangements influence employee behavior and identify strategies to enhance collaboration. 
My motivation behind this paper is to understand the in-depth application of pattern recognition for employee behavior within the workplace.

<h2>
The Below Project has two parts:</h2>
<ol>
<li>PART I: To demonstrate the Elementary Cellular Automata in Python</li>
<li>PART II: To demonstrate the Employee Behavior using Elementary Cellular Automata</li>
</ol>

<h2>Understanding the Working of 1D Cellular Automata  </h2>
<p>At the core of 1D Cellular Automata lies a set of rules dictating the evolution of each cell based on its current state and the states of its immediate neighbors(right and left). As time progresses, the states of the cells in the automaton update according to the applied rules, leading to emergent patterns and behaviors within the system. The evolution of the cellular automaton can be visualized as a sequence of generations, where each generation represents the state of the entire row of cells at a particular time These local interactions pave the way for the emergence of complex patterns, akin to the intricate dynamics observed within workplace environments. Through visualization and iterative evolution, we gain a deeper understanding of how simple rules govern the collective behavior of employees, mirroring real-world scenarios</p>

<h2>Employee Behavior Using 1D Cellular Automata</h2>
<p>In the realm of organizational management, understanding employee behavior, particularly in terms of performance dynamics, is crucial for fostering productivity and growth.
In this experiment, I used Performance as a factor which has the following factors.</p>
<ol>States: We start by defining states that represent different levels of performance.Let's categorize performance into three states:
<li>Low performance (0)</li>
<li>Medium performance (1)</li>
<li>High performance (2)</li>
</ol>
<h2> Understanding the Working of 2D Cellular Automata </h2>
<p>In a 2D cellular automaton, we have a grid of cells, where each cell has a state and evolves over discrete time steps according to a set of predefined rules based on its current state and the states of its neighboring cells.
At its core, Conway's Game of Life operates within a two-dimensional grid, where each cell exists in one of two states: alive or dead. The evolution of this system unfolds across discrete time steps, dictated by a handful of straightforward rules

<h2> Employee Behavior Using 2D Cellular Automata using motivation as a factor </h2>
<p>To model employee behavior using a 2D cellular automata, we represent each employee as a cell in a 2D grid. The state of each cell corresponds to the motivation level of the corresponding employee, which can be quantified on a scale ranging from low to high.</p>
