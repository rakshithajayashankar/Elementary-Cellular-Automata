# Elementary-Cellular Automata
<h2>Elementary Cellular Automata (1D) Model </h2>
<h4>
This paper aims to understand Wolfram's Cellular Automata as it provides a simple and powerful framework for studying complex systems and emergent phenomena. Using this framework for understanding and predicting employee behavior in both 1D and 2D contexts. 1D Cellular Automata Each cell represents an employee and the behavior evolvement over time based on rules depending on the state of the neighboring employees. In a 2D cellular automata, we look at how employees are arranged in a workplace which lets us observe the interactions and how patterns have emerged in a layout. This contributes to a mechanism driving employee behavior and offers insights for fostering a positive work environment. By using the 2D cellular automaton we gain insights into how spatial arrangements influence employee behavior and identify strategies to enhance collaboration. 
My motivation behind this paper is to understand the in-depth application of pattern recognition for employee behavior within the workplace.

<h2>
The Below Project has two parts:</h2>
<ol>
<li>PART I: To demonstrate the Elementary Cellular Automata in Python</li>
<li>PART II: To demonstrate the Employee Behavior using Elementary Cellular Automata</li>
</ol>
<h2>To Run the above two parts Elementary Cellular Automata code have the following prerequisites(For Windows and OS):</h2>
<ol>
<li> Python 3.10 Version The link is below
    Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/ </li>
<li> Have a Code Editor ready to run the code like (Notepad,VSCode,Juypter Notebook)</li>
<li> In the following code has two libraries  Numpy and Matplotlib </li>
    </ol>
    <li> a)To install Numpy:
        Go to Command Prompt
   type the following: pip install numpy </li>
   <li> b)To install Matplotlib:
     Go to Command Prompt 
        Type the following:
           python -m pip install -U pip
          python -m pip install -U matplotlib </li>
